# BRCA1-like Analyses

Downstream Bioinformatics and Biostatistical Investigations of BRCA1-like Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Tumors Identified by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

## Overview

The molecular features of homologous recombination (HR)-deficient, BRCA1-like breast tumors as a group is not well characterized. Here, we compared the clinical and molecular profiles of BRCA1-like ER/PR/HER2-positive breast tumors with their non-BRCA1-like counterpart. Our work provides insights into alternative classification approaches and therapeutic-targeting strategies for this heterogeneous disease subgroup.
