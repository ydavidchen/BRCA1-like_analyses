# BRCA1-like Analyses

Downstream Bioinformatics and Biostatistical Investigations of BRCA1-like Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Tumors Identified by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Binary Classifier

## Overview

The molecular features of homologous recombination-deficient, BRCA1-like breast tumors as a group is not well characterized. Here, we compared epidemiological and molecular profiles of BRCA1-like ER/PR/HER2-positive breast tumors with their non-BRCA1-like counterpart. Our work provides insights into alternative classification and therapeutic-targeting strategies.
